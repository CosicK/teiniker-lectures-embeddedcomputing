# From struct to class

In this example, we turn a C like struct into a C++ class.
Both are user-defined data types, but we will see that C ++ classes 
have some advantages.

## struct



## class



Once we have implemented a class, we can create many instances (called objects)
from it. These objects can be created either on the stack or on the heap memory segment.

### Objects created on the stack


### Objects created on the heap
