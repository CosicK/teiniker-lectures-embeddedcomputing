Exercise: Inheritance - User and Admin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User --[1]-> Mail
 ^
 |
Admin
 
Given a class diagram, implement the classes "Admin" which inherits from "User"
and adds a new attribute "password" of type string. Also implement the constrctor
and the following methods:
	string password();
	void password(const string& password);

1) Define the header file "Admin.h"

2) Implement the classes in "Admin.cpp" 

3) Test your implementation using the "UserTest.cpp" class.

Note that the Makefile is already implementet - don't forget to respect 
the project's layout.
