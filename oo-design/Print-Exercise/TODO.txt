Exercise: Inheritance - Print
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a header file "Print.h":

├── include
│   └── Print.h
├── src
├── test
│   └── PrintTest.cpp
├── Makefile
└── TODO.txt

1. Implement the subclass ConsolePrint
---------------------------------------
Implement all "print()" methods in a way that they use the abstract method 
"write(int c)" to write every single character of their parameters. For these 
implementations, create a file called "Print.cpp".

Create a inherited class named "ConsolePrint" (ConsolePrint.h, ConsolePrint.cpp)
which implements the abstract "write(int c)" method by using the "putchar(c)"
function from the C standard library (don't forget to #include <cstdio>).

Use "PrintTest.cpp" to verify your implementations.

Note that the Makefile is already implementet - don't forget to respect 
the project layout.
