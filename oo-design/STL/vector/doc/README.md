# Standard Library: Vector

A vector is a sequence of elements of a given type. The elements are 
stored continuously in memory.
Unlike arrays, the vector size can change dynamically, with the storage 
being handled automatically by the container.
The elements of a vector may have any type T that is assignable and 
copyable.
