Exercise: Classes and Objects 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User --[1]-> Mail

Given a class diagram, implement the classes "User" and "Mail" as well as the
directed association with multiplicity 1 between them.

1) Define the header files "User.h" and "Mail.h"

2) Implement the classes in "User.cpp" and "Mail.cpp"

3) Test your implementation using the "UserTest.cpp" class.

Note that the Makefile is already implementet - don't forget to respect 
the project layout.
